// statements vs expressions

// it's important to know the difference for React because the rule is that you can only have expressions inside jsx

var count = 1 + 2;  //one plus 2 here is an expression but the 

if (true) { // if is an expression
    // 
}

for() { //for is an expression and so on

}

while()

try {

} catch(e) {

}


// if we want to write an if statement as an expression we can use the TERNARY OPERATOR
